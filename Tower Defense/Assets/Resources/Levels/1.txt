As the game progresses, each new level will have more enemies to defeat and more allies to give you money.
The Enemy:Ally ratio cutoff defines what ratio of Enemies to Allies the tower must meet to shoot. 0 will shoot if any Enemy is present. 1 will shoot if Enemies equals Allies, and -1 will shoot at everything.
